# @knyt/clerk

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f1f128: - Update all relative import paths to be explicit by add file extensions.
  - This improves compatibility with tools that require explicit file extensions in import statements; making the project more runtime agnostic.
  - Update Bun engine requirement to "^1.3.0" in all package.json files.
    - Run `bun upgrade` to update the latest version of Bun.
    - This is a `minor` change because we're still in the `0.x` version range; also the public API of the package remains unchanged.
