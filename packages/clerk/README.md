- **Extensibility**: Class-based but composition-friendly, supporting both inheritance and wrapper patterns for customization.
- **Async**: Seamlessly handles dispatched async functions and exposes actions as an observable stream.
- **Familiar API**: Follows Flux Standard Action (FSA) for easy adoption by Flux/Redux developers.
