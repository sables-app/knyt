## Key features

- **Observability**: Stores are both observables and observers, supporting reactive state management for full state, selections, and dispatched actions.
- **Batteries-included**: Provides built-in utilities for reducers, action creators, selectors, and debug logging.
- **Extensibility**: Class-based but composition-friendly, supporting both inheritance and wrapper patterns for customization.
- **Async**: Seamlessly handles dispatched async functions and exposes actions as an observable stream.
- **Familiar API**: Follows Flux Standard Action (FSA) for easy adoption by Flux/Redux developers.
